# Numerical Methods Using MATLAB

Welcome to this repository! It contains MATLAB code implementing a variety of numerical methods—powerful tools for solving mathematical problems like differential equations, root-finding, and integration when analytical solutions aren’t feasible. Whether you’re a student, engineer, or researcher, these scripts can help you explore and apply numerical techniques with ease.

## What’s Inside?
This collection includes implementations of popular numerical methods, such as:
- **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)**: For solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- **Euler’s Method**: A simple approach to ODEs.
- **Gauss-Jacobi**: For finding roots of equations.
- and more...

## Why Use This Repository?
- Ready-to-run MATLAB scripts for quick experimentation.
- Clear examples to learn or teach numerical techniques.
- Adaptable code for your own projects or simulations.
